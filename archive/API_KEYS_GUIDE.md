## Troubleshooting

### "Porcupine not working"
- Make sure PyAudio is installed (can be tricky on Windows)
- Check that your mic is working
- Verify ACCESS_KEY in api_keys.py

### "Spotify says no devices"
- Open Spotify on ANY device (PC, phone, tablet)
- Start playing any song
- Then Zephyr can control it

### "Calendar won't authorize"
- Make sure you created OAuth credentials (not API key)
- Application type must be "Desktop app"
- Redirect URI not needed for desktop OAuth

### "News not working"
- RSS news should always work (no key needed)
- If using NewsAPI, check your daily limit (100/day free)
