# 🎉 ZEPHYR 2.0 - NATURAL LANGUAGE UPDATE!

## What's New? 🚀

### 1. 🗣️ **Natural Language Understanding (NLP)**
Talk to Zephyr like you talk to a human! No more rigid commands.

**Before (Old way):**
```
play song Blinding Lights
weather in Toronto
new project Portfolio Site
```

**Now (Natural way):**
```
play some drake for me
what's the weather like in toronto?
I want to build a portfolio website
tell me a joke
what should i work on today?
remember that my birthday is in march
```

### 2. 🎨 **Beautiful New UI**
- ✨ **BIGGER Window**: 600x400 (from 480x180) - More space!
- 🌟 **GLOWING Border**: Animated cyan pulse effect
- 💫 **Enhanced Sparkles**: More sparkle variations with color cycling
- 📜 **SCROLLABLE Text**: Can now scroll to read long responses!
- 🎭 **Better Animations**: Faster typing (10ms/char), better indicators

### 3. 🔇 **No More Monotone Voice!**
Voice is now **DISABLED by default**. No more robotic speech!
- To enable voice: Edit `config.json` and set `"enable_voice": true`

### 4. 🎯 **Smart vs Fallback Modes**

#### With Gemini AI (Smart Mode):
- Understands natural conversation
- Can chat and answer questions
- Extracts intent from ANY phrasing
- Conversational responses

#### Without Gemini (Fallback Mode):
- Still works with simple commands
- Uses regex pattern matching
- More rigid command structure

   ```

2. **Press Ctrl+Alt+Z**

3. **Try natural commands:**

## 💡 TIPS

1. **Talk Naturally**: Don't worry about exact phrasing. Just talk like you're texting a friend!

2. **Without Gemini API**: Zephyr still works, but use more specific commands like:
   - "play song Drake"
   - "weather in Toronto"
   - "new project Portfolio"

3. **Scroll Away**: Long responses? No problem! Scroll up/down to read everything.

4. **Voice Optional**: Enable voice in config.json if you want responses spoken (but it's still monotone).

5. **Escape is King**: Press Escape anytime to hide Zephyr.
